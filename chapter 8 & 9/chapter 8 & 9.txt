The chosen page is Google.com 

1. The page feels almost too empty

* Google’s homepage is super clean, which is good — but for some people it can feel a bit too empty.

* It doesn’t really guide new users on what they can search for.

Improvement:

* Add a small helpful hint under the search bar, like:
 “Try searching for images, news, places, or anything else…”

2. Buttons can be a bit small on phones

* On mobile, the “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky” buttons are sometimes a little small, making them harder to tap.

Improvement:

* Make the buttons slightly larger for easier tapping.

3. The search bar outline is very light

* The grey border around the search bar is sometimes hard to see, especially on dim screens.

 Improvement:

* Use a slightly darker border so it stands out better.
